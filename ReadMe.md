# Information

Hello! Thank you for choosing my discord bot template!

Please keep in mind that this template is still undergoing development, every release will *usually* be completely stable.

But please keep in mind that I plan on updating this regularly as I learn more [Discord.js](https://discord.js.org/#/)features.

## Template currently includes:
* Interaction Handler
  1. (/) Commands
      * Template command
      * Commands command
  3. Message Buttons
  4. Select Menus
      * String
      * Role
      * User
      * Channel
  5. Autocomplete Options
* Built in handler runner
* Crash Handler (disabled by default)
* Handler for global constants (objects, functions, variables, etc that remain the same and can be accessed by all scripts)

And thats it for now, but I always plan on adding more until a new stable version of [Discord.js](https://discord.js.org/#/) is released and I have completed the template for that.
