# Information

Hello! Thank you for choosing my discord bot template!

Please keep in mind that this template is still undergoing development, every release will *usually* be completely stable.
But please keep in mind that I plan on updating this regularly as I learn more discord.js features.

## Template currently includes:
* Interaction Handler
  1. (/) Commands
  2. Message Buttons
  3. Select Menus
      * String
      * Role
      * User
      * Channel
  4. Autocomplete Options
* Built in handler runner
* Crash Handler (disabled by default)

And thats it for now, but I always plan on adding more until a new stable version of Discord.js is released and I have completed the template for that.
